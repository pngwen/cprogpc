This is my entering and adaptation of the programs from

  Complete C Language Programming for the IBM-PC

This book contains two applications meant to teach C programming on
the IBM PC.  These are developed gradually over several chapters.  The
book does not mention a specific compiler, but judging from its age
and the code samples it contains, it seems to target a variant of
C that is somewhere between K&R traditional C and ANSI C.  

My conversions are mainly those changes needed to adapt the code for
compilation in gcc on a modern UNIX system.  I am also adding make
files to facilitate easy building.

The program text begins in chapter 3. I will tag each chapter and
enter notes about page numbers and comments as I go.  My purpose in
doing this is to study this example of project based learning as
I believe that Troy's handling of this project is quite effective.
(Though I may be biased as this is how I learned C programming back in
the mid 1990's.)
